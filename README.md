# shell-parse

Parse bash scripts into AST's

## Synopsis

```ocaml
module.exports := (String) => Object
```

_(better synopsis will come after real tests)_

## Description

This thing parses strings containing bash scripts into an AST that you might
execute using an interpreter or something. The AST structure is still in flux,
so you probably don't want to build on this just yet!

## Examples

See [the tests](tests) for all the things that can be parsed.
